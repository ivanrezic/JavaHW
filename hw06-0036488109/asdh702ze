The copy command expects two arguments: source file name and destination file name (i.e. paths and
names). Is destination file exists, you should ask user is it allowed to overwrite it. Your copy command must
work only with files (no directories). If the second argument is directory, you should assume that user wants
to copy the original file into that directory using the original file name. You must implement copying
yourself: you are not allowed to simply call copy methods from Files class.
